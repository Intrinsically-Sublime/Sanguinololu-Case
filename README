---Descriptions---

Case for Sanguinololu 

Built in cooling duct for Pololu drivers, mosfets and voltage regulator.

Snap together fit.

Push button for reset.

Light.stl is a diffuser for the indicator L.E.D. to be printed in clear material. It will hopefully transfer the light from the L.E.D. to the outside of the case.

Modelled with Blender 2.57 and exported directly to STL.

Update
Made a small change to case top for clearance of mosfet. (easily cut away if you have printed the original)
